# Rollup Improvement Proposals (RIPs)

> **_ATTENTION_**: The RIPs repository is in the startup phase, and so is undergoing many changes. Both the process and how RIPs will be written and governed is still being worked on. Feedback encouraged on [Ethereum Magicians](https://ethereum-magicians.org/).

The goal of the RIP project is to standardize and provide high-quality documentation for Rollups in Ethereum ecosystem. This repository tracks past and ongoing improvements to Ethereum's Rollup ecosystem in the form of Rollup Improvement Proposals (RIPs).

**All RIPs are optional.**  RIPs are and will always remain optional standards for Rollups and participants in the larger EVM ecosystem. RIPs and RollCall are not a governance process.
